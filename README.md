## Installation

ksvd requires:

* A system installation of MPI
* R version 3.0.0 or higher
* The pbdDMAT, pbdSLAP, and pbdMPI packages, as well as their dependencies.

<!-- Assuming you meet the system dependencies, you can install the stable version from CRAN using the usual `install.packages()`:

```r
install.package("ksvd")
``` -->

The development version is maintained on GitHub, and can easily be installed by any of the packages that offer installations from GitHub:

```r
remotes::install_github("RBigData/ksvd")
```
